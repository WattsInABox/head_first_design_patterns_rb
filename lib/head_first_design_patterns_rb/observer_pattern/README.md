# Observer Pattern

NOTES
- Using observer_pattern so we don't conflict with Observer (the top level module)
- Using a much more slack testing procedure starting with this chapter so I can 
speed my way through the book. I'm now testing at a high level and not focusing 
on writing proper unit tests. We can always go back and write the tests after. 
Feel free to contribute!
