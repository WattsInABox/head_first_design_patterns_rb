# Head First Design Patterns in Ruby

Code samples for the book *Head First Design Patterns*, written in Ruby. Originally, the book includes only Java examples. Having seen someone else write the C++ samples and contribute them back, I figured while I was going through the book, I would use Ruby and put this out there for the community.

I tried to keep things in line with the book so as you're following along, you can use 
each commit in this repository to follow the different points. I'll set out to tag
commits so that it is more meaningful and easier to find your place in the book.

If you're just wanting to find your place in the book by chapter, here are the chapters
by code namespace:

Chapter 1 - Strategy
Chapter 2... coming soon
